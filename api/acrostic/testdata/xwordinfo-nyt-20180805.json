If seeds from a local plant fall to the ground, perhaps the ones that germinate farthest south will not survive, and the ones that sprout a bit north will. Slowly but surely, the population of growing things that like cool or cold temperatures will creep every northward, to a cooler climate. Even the oak trees are moving northward, with the help of squirrels.</p>",
